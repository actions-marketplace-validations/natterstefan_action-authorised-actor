[![Test](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-authorised-actor/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-authorised-actor/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![CodeQL](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-authorised-actor/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/natterstefan/action-authorised-actor/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

> Execute a GitHub Action only if the (triggering) actor is authorised to do so.

## Use Case

Instead of adding `if` conditions here and there to determine if the actor is authorised, use this action to simplify the process.

## Usage

Add the action to your workflow, define `actor` (optional, `env.GITHUB_ACTOR` by default) and `authorisedActors` and decide if the workflow should fail silently (`failSilently`) or not.

### Before

```yml
- name: Release Tag
  if: ${{ github.actor == 'username' }}
  run: npx semantic-release
```

### After

```yml
- name: Can actor release?
  uses: natterstefan/action-authorised-actor@v1
  with:
    # JSON: string[]
    authorisedActors: |
      [
        "octocat",
        "natterstefan",
        "nektos/act"
      ]
    # or utilise GitHub Secrets, to obfuscate who's part of the list
    # authorisedActors: ${{secrets.authorisedActor}}

# if `failSilently` was set to `false`, this step will not start if the actor is
# not authorised (included in `authorisedActors`). Instead the workflow will
# exit with 1 (=failure).
- name: Release Tag
  run: npx semantic-release
```

Take a look at more examples in the
[`test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml#L24) Workflow file.

## Development

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This
> won't work with versions older than 16, for instance.

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Build the package for distribution

```bash
# package the source files
npm run package
# afterward create a release with the release GitHub action
```

Run the tests

```bash
npm run package # or npm run dev (watch mode)
npm test
```

Test the workflow locally with <https://github.com/nektos/act>!

```bash
# or npm run dev (watch mode)
npm run package

# in another terminal window run
act -j test_failSilenty_True
act -s authorisedActor="[nektos/act]" -j test_failSilenty_true_with_Secret

# Uncomment test case first, as this one will exit with 1 (=failure)
act -j testFailSilentyFalse
```
